Thank you for wanting to help us improve the Mullvad VPN app by reporting
issues.

**Before reporting an issue**, please note that this is **not** the correct
place for:
* General Mullvad support - contact support@mullvad.net for that

* Bugs and issues regarding the old Mullvad client.

  With the old Mullvad client we mean the one written in python and
  with version numbers such as 65, 66, 67 and similar.
  This source code repository is only for the new Mullvad VPN app with version
  numbers looking like `<year>.<number>`, such as 2018.1 and so on.


Please proceed and report an issue if you have found a bug or a problem with
the new *Mullvad VPN app*, the one being developed in this repository.
